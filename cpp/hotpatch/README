   https://github.com/yunabe/practice/blob/master/google/README

## How to run an example program ##

 1. make example

 2. ./example --logtostderr --hotpatch_library_dir=./

    The example shows pid at first.
    Then it shows outputs of "int func(int)" in example_lib.cc

 3. Change the behavior of "func" in example_lib.cc

 4. make example.so

 5. Send SIGALRM to make the process load a new shared library.

    kill -ALRM <pid>

 6. "func" in the process is updated and outputs change.


## Misc ##
Note that os.cc, os.h and strutil.h were copied from
